I used the potpourri as inspiration for this program. Basically just how to give the command from the html to the js and then have the js return stuff to the html. But I made sure to change the variable names and also made things easier for me to understand

There are very few requirements to using this, either click the button or hit enter to roll 5 new dice and have the feilds output your results.
